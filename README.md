2. Executive Summary Summarize the entire project, the business problem, the solution, the number impact, and important next steps. This may be the only part read.
3. Business Problem Clearly outline why you did the project and the problem you are trying to solve. This shows you are thinking about the business impact.
4. Methodology Briefly discuss the analysis type used (e.g., funnel analysis, statistical analysis) and why those methods were chosen.
5. Specific Skills List the tools (SQL, PowerBI, Python) and, critically, the specific skills used within those tools (e.g., CTEs, window functions) to hit relevant buzzwords.
6. Results and Business Recommendations Summarize what you learned and, most importantly, what you recommend for the business. Focus on what business stakeholders care about.
